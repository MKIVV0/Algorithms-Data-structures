# Algorithms & Data Structures
Classic algorithms and data structures are treated.

 # Description
 I tried to put in practice the things I learned from the Algorithms & Data Structures course in university.
 The algorithms and data structures are implemented in both C and Java, which I learned in university as well.
 
 # Implemented Data Structures
 - Concatenated List (java)
 - Stack (java)
 - Queue (java)

# Implemented Algorithms
