# Algorithms & Data Structures
Classic algorithms and data structures are treated.

 # Description
 I tried to put in practice the things I learned from the Algorithms & Data Structures course in university.
 The algorithms and data structures are implemented in both C and Java, which I learned in university as well.
 
 The algorithms/data structures implemented are strictly related to what I treated in the course, so no extra 
 work on extra topics has been done. That is beacuse the syllabus is already very dense, hence the workload is heavy.
 Every piece of code was implemented with the aim of understanding the topics treated during the course and in 
 preparation for the exam.
 
 # Implemented Data Structures
 - Concatenated List (java, c)
 - Stack (java)
 - Queue (java)

# Implemented Algorithms
- Breadth First Search (java - myAdjList.java file)
- Depth First Search (java - myAdjList.java file)
